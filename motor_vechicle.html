            Hi there.... my name is Philip Anyanful the HOD of the Motor
            Vechicle Mechanic Certified Automobile Engineer with over 10 years
            working experience here to show you all the tecnics and skills you
            need to help you become a better Motor Engineer. I take you throught
            the course where we tackle it based on about seventy percent(70%)
            practicals and thirty percent(30%) theory. Come and lets change you
            to be a certified Fitter.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>tools we use</span> As mechanical engineerers we have a saying
            that our tools is our life and these are the basic tools that are
            required of you as a mechanical engineerer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="fw-bold">Torgue wrench</li>
            <li class="fw-bold">Bench Vice</li>
            <li class="fw-bold">Hammer</li>
            <li class="fw-bold">Mallet</li>
            <li class="fw-bold">Set of spanners(open and close end type)</li>
            <li class="fw-bold">Tin Shears</li>
            <li class="fw-bold">set of pliers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are are a few of the basic tools that would be required by as
            an electrical engineerer most of these tool would be provided by the
            school to you
          </p>
          <p>
            we have trained a lot of students whom we have mould into qualified
            personnel of which some are gracefully employed or they have their
            own works for which they are masters of. Most of which is because
            students are taught by highly qualified and skilled instructor who
            are Degree and higher National Diploma Holders(HND)
          </p>

          <p>
            Attachments students go for attachments at the end of their train in
            school to further their skills in on-the-job experience which is
            mandatory for all engineerers in addition to that students are fully
            involved in when ever we take an external contract student get to
            apply and show their skills fully with real projects of servicing
            clients cars of which sometimes school and staff vechicles are
            tested and serviced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taking interest in other course is allowed in NVM provided the
            student is able to keep up with internal department works and the
            students wises to learn other trades. Other than that student MUST!!
            stay forcused and impove themself in their field.
